This a lightweight form generation module, which can be used with either
CGI.pm (version 2 or 3), or (inside mod_perl) Apache::Request.
The module provides similar facilities to CGI.pm's HTML tag generation
routines, but is restricted to form field generation tags, with sticky values.
Also, the interface is not so flexible as CGI.pm's, in order to keep the code
size down.

Changes since version 0.04:
  Added set_sticky() method, useful if you ad parameters after creation
  Added values_as_labels() method, to allow labels to default to their values
  Added values_as_labels attribute to checkbox_group()/radio_group()/select()



This module is copyright 2001 Peter Haworth. You may use and distribute this
module according to the same terms as Perl is distributed under.
