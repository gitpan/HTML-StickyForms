This a lightweight form generation module, which can be used with either
CGI.pm, or (inside mod_perl) Apache::Request. The module provides similar
facilities to CGI.pm's HTML tag generation routines, but is restricted to
form field generation tags, with sticky values. Also, the interface is not
so flexible as CGI.pm's, in order to keep the code size down.

Changes since version 0.01:
  Added select()
  Combined checkbox_group() and radio_group()
  Added documentation
