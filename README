This a lightweight form generation module, which can be used with either
CGI.pm (version 2 or 3), or (inside mod_perl) Apache::Request.
The module provides similar facilities to CGI.pm's HTML tag generation
routines, but is restricted to form field generation tags, with sticky values.
Also, the interface is not so flexible as CGI.pm's, in order to keep the code
size down.

Changes since version 0.02:
  Fixed trim_params() under Apache::Request
